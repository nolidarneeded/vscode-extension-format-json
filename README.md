Just run `Format JSON` to set the language of the current  
file to JSON and format the content in one step.  
Also works in new Untitled (not saved) files.

Old instruction, do not work with Visual Studio Code `1.96.2` and (probably) later

1. `Cmd + K` and then `M` to complete the command
2. Type JSON
3. Hit Enter
4. `Option + Shift + F` to format the content
